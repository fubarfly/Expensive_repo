# Getting Started with QueryDesk

After successfully completing sign-up, you will land on the **Databases** page. A database called **Devhub** is already connected and ready to use. While the Devhub database is the database for your instance of QueryDesk, you can use it to test queries and the major features outlined in this guide. No additional setup is required to start exploring.

> [!WARNING]
> Keeping access restricted to the Devhub database is essential, as unrestricted access could allow anyone to modify access and approval rules for the entire product.

> [!NOTE]
> As the Devhub database is your QueryDesk instance, you want to avoid doing anything destructive. See previous warning.

<!-- screenshot: Databases page showing Devhub entry with Connect button -->

The Devhub database is a live PostgreSQL instance. You can use it to run queries, test approval flows, and verify audit logging before connecting your own databases.

The left navigation gives you access to everything in QueryDesk:

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Databases** | Your connected databases and the starting point for running queries |
| **Pending queries** | Queries waiting for approval before execution |
| **AI assistant** | Query generation using an AI model you connect via API key |
| **Query library** | Your saved private queries |
| **Shared queries** | Queries shared across your organization |
| **Labels** | Tags for organizing queries in the **Query library** only |
| **Dashboards** | Data views built from your database connections |
| **Workflows** | Automated multi-step processes combining queries, API calls, and notifications |
| **Audit log** | A complete record of every query run against every connected database |

---

## Connect to the Devhub database

On the Databases page, click **Connect** on the Devhub entry. This opens the query interface.

<!-- screenshot: Query interface showing left panel with table list, query pane, and results pane -->

The interface has three main areas:

- **Left panel:** lists all tables in the connected database. Click any table name to load a `SELECT` query for that table automatically.
- **Query pane:** where you write or edit SQL.
- **Results pane:** where query output appears after execution.

---

## Run a query

Type a query in the query pane, or click a table name in the left panel to generate one. Click **Run query** to execute it. For example, this will return every column from the `organizations` table, along with basic details about each one.

```sql
SELECT
  column_name,
  data_type,
  is_nullable,
  column_default
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
  AND table_name = 'organizations'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
```

Results appear in the results pane below. From there, you can:

- Click **Export** to download the results as a CSV file.
- Click **Share** to generate a shareable link.

### Query options

The dropdown arrow next to **Run query** exposes additional settings before execution:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Default limit** | Caps the number of rows returned. Also adjustable via the gear icon in the command bar. |
| **Timeout (seconds)** | Stops the query if it hasn't completed within the specified time. Also adjustable via the gear icon in the command bar. |
| **Run as** | Selects which database credential the query runs under. |
| **Analyze query** | Generates a query plan instead of returning results. When enabled, the action button changes to **Analyze query**, and results are replaced with the query analysis. |

### Saving a query

Click **Save query** to open a dialog where you can name the query and optionally mark it as private. Private queries are only visible to you. Queries saved without the private flag (default) are accessible to your team through the Query library.

> [!TIP]
> Don't know SQL? You can bring your own AI model and train it to be schema-aware for your databases, so your team can describe what they want in plain language and get a working query back. See [Set up the AI assistant](#set-up-the-ai-assistant), coming next!

---

## Set up the AI assistant

The AI assistant lets anyone on your team describe what they want in plain language and get a query back, without needing to know SQL. It requires connecting an external AI model using an API key you supply. One AI model can be configured per QueryDesk instance. Through the magic of modern technology, we ensure the AI you bring is schema-aware for your specific databases so the queries it generates are accurate.

Click **AI assistant** in the left navigation (1), then click **Setup AI** (2).

<!-- screenshot: Query interface with AI assistant highlighted in left nav (callout 1) and Setup AI button (callout 2) -->

This opens Settings. Navigate to the **Integrations** tab and click **Settings** next to **AI** (3).

<!-- screenshot: Settings > Integrations tab showing GitHub, Linear, Slack, AI, and Calendar Events entries; AI Settings button highlighted (callout 3) -->

Select a model from the **Model** dropdown (4), enter your **API key** for that model (5), and click **Save** (6).

<!-- screenshot: AI settings modal showing Model dropdown set to Claude Opus 4 (callout 4), API KEY field (callout 5), and Save button (callout 6) -->

Once saved, return to the **AI assistant** in the left navigation to open a conversation. Describe what you want to query in plain language. The assistant will generate SQL that you can run or edit before executing. Train the model on your schema to improve the relevance of its suggestions for your specific databases.

## Adding users to approve queries

To test the approval functionality and user setup, it is recommended to set up another user. The process is as follows:

> [!NOTE]
> It is not strictly necessary to set up another user in order to test approvals. As a super admin, you can both submit a query for approval and approve it. Obviously, this is not a best practice in prod, but it is useful for illustrating how approvals operate.

1. Click the main **Settings** gear icon in the left-hand navigation pane.
2. Click **Users** in the Settings ribbon.
3. Click the **Invite User** button.

<!-- screenshot: Settings > Users page showing Settings gear (callout 1), Users tab (callout 2), and Invite User button (callout 3) -->

4. In the **Invite user** window, add the name and email address of the new user and click the **Invite** button.

<!-- screenshot: Invite user modal with Name field showing "Mark Smith", Email field showing "foo@example.com", and Invite button -->

5. Click **Add seats** in the Users Settings section to add a seat so the new user has a QueryDesk license.
6. This opens the **Billing** Settings page. You will not be charged for this during your trial period.
7. Enter the number of seats to add, then click **Add seats**. Return to the **Users** Settings page.

<!-- screenshot: Billing page showing Seats to Add field with value 1 (callout 5) and Add seats button (callout 6) -->

<!-- screenshot: Users page showing 3/6 seats used, Add seats link (callout 4), user list with Mark Smith showing "No license assigned" status and kebab menu (callout 7), with tooltip "Once you have added the additional seat (step 5 & 6), click on the kebab menu item" -->

8. As shown in the image above, click the kebab menu (⋮) next to the user you added (step 7), then select **Assign license**. You can make any other changes to the user at this time.

<!-- screenshot: User detail panel for Mark Smith showing Assign license button (callout 8), GitHub User, Linear User, Name on OOO Calendar fields, Permissions checkboxes (Super Admin, Manager, Billing Admin), and Roles/Teams sections -->

9. The user is now ready to join your instance/trial.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Invited users do not receive an email invitation. Invited users must log in using the URL provided at the top of the page. For example:
> `https://g3flb73q.devhub.cloud` or `https://<your_company_name>.devhub.cloud`

10. Upon navigating to the trial instance URL, the new user will be prompted to log in and create an account. Once that process is completed, the user will be directed to the trial instance.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are testing this as a single user, make sure to use a different browser or private browsing window to avoid logging into the same session as the original user.

11. Once the new user has logged in, **Connect** to the Devhub database again and select **Settings** from the database menu.

<!-- screenshot: Database menu showing Settings option highlighted -->

12. Once in the database Settings, scroll down to **RBAC** (**R**ole-**B**ased **A**ccess **C**ontrol) and click **Add user**.

<!-- screenshot: Database Settings page showing RBAC section with Add user and Add role buttons, highlighted with red box -->

13. In the **Assign User** dropdown, select the user you want to add and click **Add user**.

<!-- screenshot: Assign User modal with Mark Smith selected and Add user button -->

14. The new user should now appear in the **RBAC** section of the Devhub database settings. Select the **Permission** dropdown and choose **Approver**. This user can now approve queries.

<!-- screenshot: RBAC section showing Mark Smith with Permission dropdown open, showing "Run Queries" and "Approver" options, with Approver highlighted -->

---

## Submit a query for approval

The Devhub database comes pre-configured with two credentials:

- **devhub_readonly:** a read-only user. Queries run immediately with no review required, as the user only has read-only access to the database.
- **devhub:** a read/write user. Queries require one approval before they execute.

<!-- screenshot: Database Settings > Credentials section showing devhub_readonly (Reviews: 0, Default checked) and devhub (Reviews: 1) credentials -->

This two-credential setup reflects a recommended best practice: a read-only credential for unrestricted data exploration, and a read/write credential with a review gate on any query that can modify data.

> [!NOTE]
> You can have as many reviews in the Reviews field as you have approvers. For example, setting Reviews to `5` instead of `1` would require 5 separate approvals from 5 separate reviewers.

To see the approval flow in action:

1. Click the dropdown arrow next to **Run query** and set **Run as** to `devhub`.
2. Type a query in the query pane. A simple `SELECT` statement is fine.
3. Click **Request review**.

<!-- screenshot: Run query modal showing INSERT INTO query, Default Limit 500, Timeout 10s, Run As set to "devhub", "1 review required" notice, Run Automatically on Approval and Analyze Query toggles, and Request review button -->

Because the `devhub` credential requires one review, the query is not executed immediately. It is submitted to the **Pending queries** queue instead. Both the submitting user and the reviewer can access the pending query via **Pending queries** in the left-hand navigation.

---

## Approve a pending query

Click **Pending queries** in the left navigation. Your submitted query appears here.

<!-- screenshot: Pending queries view showing submitted INSERT INTO query with database/user/timeout metadata, query text, 0/1 approvals counter, and action buttons (link icon, Edit, Delete, comment icon) with callout labels -->

Each pending query displays the database and credentials it will run against, the timeout setting, when it was last edited, and the full query text.

From this view, the submitting user can:

- Click the link icon to copy the link to the clipboard
- Click **Edit** to modify the query
- Click **Delete** to discard it
- Click the comment icon to comment on the query

The second user you created in [Adding users to approve queries](#adding-users-to-approve-queries) above will act as the approver. When that user checks **Pending queries**, they will see the following:

<!-- screenshot: Pending queries view from approver perspective showing same query with Approve button highlighted, link icon, and comment icon, with callout labels -->

From this view, a user with approver permissions can:

- Click the link icon to copy the link to the clipboard
- Click **Approve** to approve the query (note that approving does not execute the query)
- Click the comment icon to comment on the query

Once the query has been approved, the original submitting user will see a **Run Query** button appear on that query in their Pending queries list. Click **Run Query** to execute it.

<!-- screenshot: Pending queries view showing approved query with 1/1 approvals, Run Query button highlighted, and tooltip "The query shows approved and has the option to run" -->

Once a query has been run, it is removed from the **Pending queries** view.

When your team uses QueryDesk in production, this separation between submitter and approver is the intended workflow. A user submits a write query; an engineer, DevOps lead, or designated approver reviews it before it runs. Queries that pose a real risk to production data don't execute until at least a second set of eyes clears them.

---

## Check the audit log

Click **Audit log** in the left navigation.

Every query that ran during this session is captured here: the database it ran against, the user and credentials, the timestamp, and the full query text. The queries you ran as `devhub_readonly` are here. So is the query you submitted and approved as `devhub`.

<!-- screenshot: Audit log showing date range Dec 22, 2025 - Mar 21, 2026, with query entries including run timestamps, failure indicators, and error notification callout "Error notifications are provided to supply useful information when queries fail" -->

No configuration required. The audit log is always on. Watching. Waiting.

During a SOC 2 audit or an internal security review, this record is immediately available. There is no manual log reconstruction and no hunting across systems; every access event is captured automatically.

---

## Connect your own database

The Devhub database covers everything you need to evaluate QueryDesk's core features. When you're ready to connect a real database, click **New database** in the upper right of the Databases page.

If you don't have the connection details (hostname, port, database name, and credentials), get them from your IT, DevOps, Engineering, or Operations team before starting this step.

### Database configuration

- **Display name** - any name that's useful to you.
- **Database IP or hostname** - the IP address or hostname only. For example: `10.1.0.132` or `myproddatabase.123456789.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com`.
- **Port** - the port for your database type. Leave blank to use the default for the selected type.
- **Database name** - the actual database name, not the display name. For MySQL, this is the schema name.
- **Database type** - select from: PostgreSQL, MySQL, ClickHouse, SQL Server, Oracle, etc.
- **Agent** - used to connect to databases inside a private network. Agents are configured in Settings. If you're unsure whether your database requires one, ask your IT, DevOps, or Engineering team. For more information, see the [Connecting to Private Databases with an Agent](https://docs.querydesk.com/guides/agent) guide.
- **Group (optional)** - groups multiple databases together in the Databases list.

### Credentials

Click **+ Add Credential** to add at least one set of database credentials.

- **Username** - the database username.
- **Password** - the password for that user.
- **Hostname (optional)** - overrides the database-level hostname for this credential if needed.
- **Reviews** - `0` executes queries immediately. Any other number holds queries in the pending queue until that many approvals are collected. A user with read-only access would typically be set to `0`.
- **Default** - when checked on a credential with Reviews set to `0`, this credential is used by default for table views and proxy connections.

> [!TIP]
> Create two credentials: a read-only user with Reviews set to `0`, and a read/write user with Reviews set to `1` or higher. The Devhub database uses exactly this pattern.

Click **Test Connection** after entering credentials to verify that QueryDesk can reach your database before saving.

### Encryption

If your database requires encryption, enable it with the toggle. You can then paste the server CA certificate, client key, and client certificate. Work with your IT, DevOps, or Engineering team if you need help obtaining these.

### Slack configuration

If you've connected Slack in Settings, enter a channel name here — for example, `#prod-query-approvals`. Query submission notifications will be sent to that channel when a query is pending review.

### Access control

By default, any user in your QueryDesk organization can run queries against a connected database, subject to any data protection policies in place. To restrict access to specific users or roles only:

1. Enable **Restrict access** on the database settings page.
2. Click **Add user** or **Add role** to assign access.
3. For each user or role, set a **Permission** (the default options are **Run Queries** and **Approver**) and optionally assign a **Data protection policy**.

Users are managed in **Settings > Users**. Roles are managed in **Settings > Roles**. Data protection policies are managed via the **Manage policies** link in the access control section of the database settings page.

### Connect

Once the configuration is complete, open the **Actions** menu in the upper right of the database settings page and select **Connect**.

## What's next

With the Devhub database explored and your own database connected, you've covered how QueryDesk handles the fundamentals: unified database access, controlled write operations with approval flows, and automatic audit logging. The following areas are worth exploring next:

- **Integrations:** connect Slack, Linear, AI, and GitHub to your QueryDesk instance to enable workflows.
- **Workflows:** automate multi-step processes by chaining database queries, API calls, Slack notifications, and human approvals into a single, repeatable operation.
- **Data protection:** configure field-level masking policies that control which columns are visible to which users, enforced automatically at query execution time so sensitive data stays in your database.
